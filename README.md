# malware-attribution-tool
repo for our capstone project - this way we can easily manage version control + collaboration

## How to Run the Tool
Place all binaries you want to analyze in one directory (let's call it `brown/`)

`python3 gensim_tool.py brown/`

This will create two subdirectories within `brown/` called `objdumpOutput` and `parsedInstructions`

### note for developers
You will probably want to create a virtual environment to run your angr project in.
[Use this link as a guide for installing/using your virtual environment.](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

### git stuff
create a branch in the GitHub

pull down your branch
`git pull`
`git checkout -b [your_branch_name] origin/[your_branch_name]`
