The image compare script can be executed like this:
python image_comp.py --first sample1.png --second sample3.png

and the images will only be displayed for about 10 seconds befor the windows closes. I am still working on that. 

Also when executing the script you may get errors if you dont have the following libraries installed:

pip install opencv-python
pip install imutils
pip install scikit-image
pip install Pillow==2.6.0
